      "My name is [Thomas Robitaille](http://mpia.de/~robitaille/) and I am the leader of a research group at the Max Planck Institut f\u00fcr Astronomie. I carry out research on star formation in the Milky-Way and other galaxies, and I use Python for my daily work. I have developed a number of Python packages for Astronomers, including [APLpy](http://aplpy.github.io), [ATpy](http://atpy.github.io), [Montage-wrapper](http://www.astropy.org/montage-wrapper/), [PyAVM](https://github.com/astrofrog/pyavm). I have also contributed to [Scipy](http://www.scipy.org) and other scientific packages, and am one of the project leaders for [Astropy](http://www.astropy.org), which is a big project to create one main Python package for Astronomy.\n",

      "What is 'Programming'?\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Being good at programming is not simply knowing a lot about a programming language, or how to write very fast programs. It is about:\n",
      "\n",
      "* understanding a problem conceptually and being able to translate them into code\n",
      "* thinking of new ways to tackle (for example) a scientific problem, and knowing what tools to use\n",
      "* writing a program that is fast enough, **not** the fastest possible\n",
      "* writing a program that can be understood by other people (or by yourself in a year!)\n",
      "\n",
      "In Science, the last point is important, because **reproducible research** and **open science** is becoming the norm in certain fields of research, which means that others have to be able to read your code, and understand what you are doing, and be able to run it themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "This course focuses on aspects of programming that would be useful to you in scientific research, but Python is a very popular language, and what you will learn will also be applicable if you decide to pursue a different career!\n",

Format is flexible, but will usually start with a mini-lecture on a new topic every week, followed by time to try/practice what was demonstrated and work on problems. Students can also work on problems at other times during the week, either in the CIP pool, or on their on laptops (see below).\n",
