      "My name is [Thomas Robitaille](http://mpia.de/~robitaille/) and I am the leader of a research group at the Max Planck Institut f\u00fcr Astronomie. I carry out research on star formation in the Milky-Way and other galaxies, and I use Python for my daily work. I have developed a number of Python packages for Astronomers, including [APLpy](http://aplpy.github.io), [ATpy](http://atpy.github.io), [Montage-wrapper](http://www.astropy.org/montage-wrapper/), [PyAVM](https://github.com/astrofrog/pyavm). I have also contributed to [Scipy](http://www.scipy.org) and other scientific packages, and am one of the project leaders for [Astropy](http://www.astropy.org), which is a big project to create one main Python package for Astronomy.\n",

Format is flexible, but will usually start with a mini-lecture on a new topic every week, followed by time to try/practice what was demonstrated and work on problems. Students can also work on problems at other times during the week, either in the CIP pool, or on their on laptops (see below).\n",

      "Solutions should be submitted individually, *not* in groups. The deadline for solutions to be handed in is **18:00 on Friday of the same week the problem set was given** (so the deadline for Problem Set 1 is 18:00 on Friday 19th April). \n",

At the start of each session, I will go over the notebook for that session, but I will not read over everything, so you can go back and look at it in detail after I have gone over it.\n",
