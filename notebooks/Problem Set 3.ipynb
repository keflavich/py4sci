      "\n",
      "This week, there is only one problem, but it will require a little more effort to complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have made a number of comments on style in previous weeks, and some of those comments are from the [PEP8 Python Style Guide](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). There is a script called [pep8.py](https://raw.github.com/jcrocholl/pep8/master/pep8.py) that can warn you about all the style issues in your code. You can download the script and use it with:\n",
      "\n",
      "    python pep8.py your_script.py\n",
      "\n",
      "and you will see output like:\n",
      "\n",
      "    your_script.py:26:2: E225 missing whitespace around operator\n",
      "    your_script.py:26:22: E231 missing whitespace after ','\n",
      "    your_script.py:29:17: E231 missing whitespace after ','\n",
      "    your_script.py:30:12: E231 missing whitespace after ','\n",
      "\n",
      "The number just after the script name is the line number. Let me know if you can't figure out what a given error means.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to encourage you to write code that follows this style guide, I will award **1 bonus point** this week if your script(s) do not raise **any** warnings/errors if I run ``pep8.py`` on it (with a maximum of 10 points for the problem set).\n",
      "\n",
      "Monte-Carlo Error Propagation\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that when you want to write a script that needs to plot, you need to add:\n",
      "\n",
      "    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
      "\n",
      "at the top of the script (this is not needed when using IPython interactively).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Part 1\n",
      "\n",
      "You have likely encountered the concept of propagation of uncertainty before (see [the usual rules here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty#Example_formulas)). The idea is that given measurements with uncertainties, we can find the uncertainty on the final result of an equation.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, let us consider the following equation:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$F = \\frac{G~M_1~M_2}{r^2}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "which gives the gravitational force between two masses $M_1$ and $M_2$ separated by a distance $r$.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us now imagine that we have two masses:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$M_1=40\\times10^4\\pm0.05\\times10^4\\rm{kg}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "and\n",
      "\n",
      "$$M_2=30\\times10^4\\pm0.1\\times10^4\\rm{kg}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "separated by a distance:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$r=3.2\\pm0.01~\\rm{m}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "where the uncertaintes are the standard deviations of Gaussian distributions which could be e.g. measurement errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also know:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$G = 6.67384\\times10^{-11}~\\rm{m}^3~\\rm{kg}^{-1}~\\rm{s}^{-2}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "(exact value, no uncertainty)\n",
      "\n",
      "Use the [standard error propagation rules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty#Example_formulas) to determine the resulting force and uncertainty in your script (you can just derive the equation by hand and implement it in a single line in your code).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we can try using a **Monte-Carlo** technique instead. The idea behind Monte-Carlo techniques is to generate many possible solutions using random numbers and using these to look at the overall results. In the above case, you can propagate uncertainties with a Monte-Carlo method by doing the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "* randomly sample values of $M_1$, $M_2$, and $r$, 1000000 times, using the means and standard deviations given above\n",
      "\n",
      "* compute the gravitational force for each set of values\n",
      "\n",
      "You should do this with Numpy arrays, and **without any loops**. You should then get an array of 1000000 different values for the forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Make a plot of the normalized histogram of these values of the force, and then overplot a Gaussian function with the mean and standard deviation derived with the standard error propagation rules. *See the solutions of the practice problems for Week 3* if you need help with this. Add axis labels to the plot, and also comment inside your script (using lines starting with ``#``) on what you see in the plot, whether the two distributions agree, etc. Make sure that you pick the range of x values in the plot wisely, so that the two distributions can be seen. Make sure there are also a sensible number of bins in the histogram so that you can compare the shape of the histogram and the Gaussian function.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Part 2\n",
      "\n",
      "Repeat the experiment above with the following values:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$M_1=40\\times10^4\\pm2\\times10^4\\rm{kg}$$\n",
      "$$M_2=30\\times10^4\\pm10\\times10^4\\rm{kg}$$\n",
      "$$r=3.2\\pm1.0~\\rm{m}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "And as above, produce a plot and comment on what you see (don't worry about the fact there are negative values of the force, this is normal given the large uncertainties on the masses and radius).\n",
      "\n",
      "Which method do you think is more accurate? Why? What do you think are the advantages of using a Monte-Carlo technique? (put answers to these questions comments in your code, with lines starting with ``#``).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Please submit the scripts (as one or two scripts depending on how you write it), and make sure they they produce PNG plots that I can check (so use ``plt.savefig`` to save the plots), but you don't need to upload the PNG files**\n",
