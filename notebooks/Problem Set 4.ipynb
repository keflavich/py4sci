      "[Extrasolar planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrasolar_planet) (or *exoplanets*) are planets that have been found around other stars than the Sun. The first extrasolar planet was discovered in 1995, and since then, over 700 exoplanets have been discovered! One method to find exoplanets is to look for dips in brightness as planets pass in front of the star, as demonstrated in the following animation:\n",

      "</center>\n",
      "\n",
      "Because other stars only appear as points because they are so far away, we have to look for changes in the brightness. However, this is difficult, because planets are typically much smaller than their host star. If we were around another star, and could observe the planets in the solar system transit in front of the Sun, Jupiter would cause the Sun to become fainter by ~1%, and the Earth would cause the Sun to become fainter by ~0.01%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the recent discoveries of exoplanets by this method have been found by the [Kepler spacecraft](http://kepler.nasa.gov/) which is a telescope that was launched into space in 2009. The reason for using a space telescope is that it is much easier to accurately measure the brightness of stars without the atmosphere in the way, which makes it easier to detect smaller planets. Kepler has observed the same part of the sky many times, and so far 131 planets have been discovered by this mission.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this practical exercise, we will analyze some of the real data from Kepler for one of the stars, to look for a planet.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, you will need to download the data (<a href=\"kepler_data.tgz\">TGZ</a> or <a href=\"kepler_data.zip\">ZIP</a>) and decompress it so that you have a folder called ``data``. This folder contains several different *lightcurves*, which give the brightness of the star against time. The first column is the time since the start of the mission, in days, and the second column is the brightness in relative units (1 is the average brightness of the star).\n",
      "\n",
      "Part 1 - Finding the transit lightcurve from a single dataset (15 points)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "1 - To start with, we will look at one of the lightcurves - ``data/kplr002571238-2009259160929_llc.txt'``. Read in the data from this file, and make a plot of brighness versus time to see what the data looks like. You will see that the brightness changes in an irregular way over time - this is mostly due to intrinsic changes in the brightness of the star, not the planet. However, you will see very small and narrow 'dips' that are evenly spaced - these are the planet transits!\n",
      "\n",
      "2 - We want to get rid of the large-scale variations that are just due to the changes in brightness of the star. Write a function that given two arrays ``x`` and ``y`` and a width ``width`` will return a new array containing *median-filtered* values of ``y``. Median filtering means that every point ``x[i]`` is replaced by the median of all values between ``x[i] - width/2.`` and ``x[i] + width/2.``. Use this function to filter the lightcurve we are currently looking at using a width of 1 day. Make a plot showing the original fluxes with black points, and the smoothed (median filtered) version as a red line on top of the points. You should see that the curve reproduces the variations in the original data, but does not include the small 'dips' due to the planet.\n",
      "\n",
      "3 - Make a *residual* plot, that is a plot that show the original data minus the smoothed version. This plots should show a mostly flat curve that includes regular dips due to the planet. Median filtering is a good way to get rid of variations in the stellar brightness that happen on longer timescales than the transit.\n",
      "\n",
      "4 - Now try and estimate the period of the transits using the plot. The easiest way to do this is to simply draw a vertical line (for example using ``plt.axvline``) at the position of one of the transits, and trying to plot a second line lining up with the second transit, then look at the difference between these times. You should be able to estimate the period correctly within plus or minus one day.\n",
      "\n",
      "5 - Make a new plot of the brightness, but now instead of showing time on the x-axis, shows the *phase*, which is:\n",
      "\n",
      "    phase = (time % period) / period\n",
      "\n",
      "where ``period`` is the period you determined in step 4. This basically shows how the flux of the star changes over the period of the variations, and is called a *folded* light-curve. If the period is correct, the transits (the dips in the lightcurve) will line up. However, it's likely that the period you found in step 4 is not perfect, so that the transits will not quite line up. Try changing the period a little either way to try and make all the transits line up, and record your value. Try and change the x-axis so that the transit happens at a phase of 0.5 (keeping the phase between 0 and 1) and make a plot of the points between a phase of 0.45 and 0.55.\n",
      "\n",
      "6 - What you should see now is essentially a combined lightcurve of several transits! We can now start answering scientific questions. For example, what is the depth of the transit relative to the brightness of the star? Can you estimate the radius of the planet compared to the star? The star is 0.85 times the radius of the Sun. How large is the planet compared to the Earth? How long does the transit last? (try and answer these questions from your lightcurve).\n",
      "\n",
      "Part 2 - Combining all the datasets to improve accuracy (5 points)\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "7 - Now read in all the datasets, and for each one, find the smoothed lightcurve and subtract it from the data. Then, combine the resulting datasets  into a single time and a single brightness array, and make a folded lightcurve (with phase on the x-axis) as in Step 6, showing the phase between 0 and 1. It's likely that you won't see the transit as well (or maybe not at all) since now that the datasets span a larger time range, you will need the period to be more accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "8 - You can either try and manually adjust the period until you get a clean folded lightcurve including all the data, or you can try and automatically determine a more accurate period. There are different ways that this can be done, so you can try and develop your own algorithm to do it. If you need any ideas, then consider for example the following algorithm, which relies on the fact that when the period is wrong, the transits are scattered around in phase, and when the period is correct, the transits are all around the same values of the phase (so the scatter in the phase values of the points in the transits is low):\n",
      "\n",
      "* Choose a period, and compute the corresponding phase as in Step 5. Then, select all points with fluxes below a certain threshold which means that they are definitely in the transit (e.g. below -0.0004).\n",
      "\n",
      "* Find the standard deviation of the phase value of these points.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Repeat for several different periods. I would recommend trying 100 or more values between 0.8 and 1.2 times the period you previously estimated\n",
      "\n",
      "* Make a plot of the standard deviation versus the period, and you should see a strong dip for the best period.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Extract the value of the phase for the lowest standard deviation\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you have this, you can once again make a folded lightcurve of the transit, and you should now see a very nice transit lightcurve.\n"
