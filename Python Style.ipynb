      "Indentation is **very** important in Python, and should **always be 4 spaces**. If you are using tabs, then this will make it very likely that you will encounter problems in future. This is because some editors/interpretors think that tabs are equivalent to 4 spaces, and some think they are equivalent to 8 spaces, so this:\n",

      "---------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, always use lowercase letters for variable names and function names. So for example, do not use ``IsPrime`` as a function name - use e.g. ``is_prime`` instead. This is because later in the course we will learn about classes, and the convention for those is to use capitalized names, e.g. ``Source``, and it makes it very useful when you are reading code to be able to distinguish between the different kinds of objects from their name.\n"
